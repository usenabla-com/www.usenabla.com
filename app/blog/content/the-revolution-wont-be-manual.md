Every time I go on Reddit, whether it's the [r/NISTControls](https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/) sub or the [r/Cybersecurity] sub, it seems like everyone has strong opinions about using GRC tools vs. just staying in Excel. I love that personally, because I think it says something about the industry that there's such a polarization that the people who use GRC tools are staunchly for their benefits regardless of the cacophany of naysayers from Excel adherents. 

But what if that's not what GRC is in the modern era? Because on some level, I agree with many of the criticisms lobbed by Excelists, and know that checkbox compliance won't ensure that our systems are as secure in practice as we want them to be in theory.
